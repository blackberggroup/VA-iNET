    &#34;The PSMT is important to me because I have seen that what I do has a real impact on the lives of Veterans. One Veteran who used it told me that it &#39;changed his life&#39;. He &#39;finally&#39; understood how to properly use his prosthetic socks and a wound he had for a long time was finally beginning to heal. He also used the accompanying infographic to explain his amputation to his grandkids. He was so appreciative.&#34;
    
    &#34;Through the development of the PSMT I learned that I was not just a task do-er, but also an innovator. I saw myself in a new light and have been inspired to bring this exciting possibility of personal transformation to my VA colleagues.&#34;

    The Prosthetic Sock Management Tool (PSMT) is a two-part organizational system that enhances a Veteran&#39;s prosthetic experience. The PSMT aids in a Veteran&#39;s education and management of prosthetic sock use. This tool helps clinicians visually demonstrate the proper way to use prosthetic socks and better manage the health of their residual limbs.
