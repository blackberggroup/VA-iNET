    &#34;Working with the developers of XanderGlasses has been very exciting and thoroughly enjoyable. I am a cochlear implant audiologist and realize the awesome benefit this device could have on helping hearing impaired Veterans to communicate more effectively with others.&#34;

item_description: >
    XanderGlasses improve communication for individuals affected by hearing loss and auditory processing disorder by using sight to augment sound. The glasses translate speech to text and project accurate real-time captions in the wearer's field of vision, allowing them to look at speakers, absorb visual cues, and refer to captions as needed. This simple, on-off device provides instant and accurate captions with or without a cloud connection.
