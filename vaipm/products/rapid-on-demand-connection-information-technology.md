    Via the <a class=text-blue href=greenhouse-initiative.html>Greenhouse Initiative</a>, frontline employees from <strong>VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System</strong>, participated in the co-design and user experience testing of this product.
    
    &#34;Unnecessary suffering or dying at-home because someone can&#39;t afford quality internet, especially when a cost-saving model of care solution is available is important to me.
    
    Developing this product made me proud of myself again, gave me a purpose, got my fight back, and increased the ratio of salt in my hair. To me, VA innovation means pushing the entire country&#39;s care model forward and sharing it in an open-source manner for all people.&#34;
