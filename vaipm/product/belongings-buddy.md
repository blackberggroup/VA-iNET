&#34;Through VA innovation we have been empowered to follow through with our idea for the &#39;Belongings Buddy&#39; (a means for Veterans to have their small belongings together in one place). It has been exciting and motivating to see this idea come to fruition and to have it so greatly supported across the VHA system. Without the support of iNET innovation it is unlikely to have been developed. The support, encouragement, and networking has been an amazing experience.&#34;,

Patients often lose personal items while in the hospital including glasses, dentures, hearing aids, and cell phones. The Belongings Buddy is a small bag that can be attached to a bed rail with multiple, brightly colored pockets to help patients keep track of personal items.
