&#34;I really felt bad for the patient and knew there had to be a way to streamline the procedure while giving comfort to the Veteran. With the very first trial the patient loved it and wanted to take it home!! Throughout the prototyping phase I had such an adrenaline rush from any design changed needed.

Since 2021, the need to reschedule patients is at ZERO, and knee procedure time has been reduced by 15 minutes. Previously, 20% of patients were rescheduled due to pain, inability to hold still, or needing sedation. The benefits of the supporter and the data I collected include decreased radiation exposure to patient and staff, rescheduling, use of anesthesia and procedure time. The meaning of VA Innovation to me is knowing that I have lots of support behind me. I have had many people cheering me on and giving great suggestions. VA Innovation is the way to go!!!!&#34;,
