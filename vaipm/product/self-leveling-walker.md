&#34;This innovation capitalized on the contributions of institutional investments by the Rehabilitation R&D Service, the VA Technology Transfer Program, the Case-Coulter Translational Research Program, and VHA Innovators Network to deliver something that can profoundly and positively impact the mobility of disabled Veterans and enable them to independently negotiate architectural barriers and take full advantage of life opportunities at home and in the community. And all without costly home modifications! I&#39;m most proud that it&#39;s been patented and licensed and poised to be disseminated commercially within and outside the VA so that Veterans and all Americans can benefit.&#34;

&#34;As a physical therapist the Self-Leveling Walker solves a lot of issues for so many of our Veterans. Stairs are always a challenge and so many people do not have the necessary handrails to safely negotiate stairs. The SLW provides an easy, safe solution. This will allow our Veterans to go home sooner and not require expensive home modifications. Working with the engineering team to come up with a solution was very satisfying.&#34;

ItemDesc: >
The Self-Leveling Walker addresses the limitations of conventional walking aids and the lack of options for teaching efficient stair ascent/descent maneuvers for patients in rehabilitation recovering from an injury. This product helps fulfill an unmet market need giving patients increased independence to safely negotiate stairs and inclines while also minimizing the cost of home adaptations and extended stays in rehabilitation settings for training.

The walker&#39;s front and rear legs are coupled such that the front legs shorten, and the rear legs lengthen by the same amount when a pair of hand levers are held down by the user. When the levers are released, the legs are locked in the new configuration for continued stair or ramp ascent/descent until re-adjusted at the end of the staircase or incline. In the default state where the legs are level and locked, the device performs exactly like a standard walker on level surfaces, making it the only walker a user will ever need regardless of the environment.
