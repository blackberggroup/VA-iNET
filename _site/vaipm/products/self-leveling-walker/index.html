<h1>Self-Leveling Walker (SLW)</h1>
<p>The Self-Leveling Walker addresses the limitations of conventional walking aids and the lack of options for teaching efficient stair ascent/descent maneuvers for patients in rehabilitation recovering from an injury. This product helps fulfill an unmet market need giving patients increased independence to safely negotiate stairs and inclines while also minimizing the cost of home adaptations and extended stays in rehabilitation settings for training.
The walker&amp;#39;s front and rear legs are coupled such that the front legs shorten, and the rear legs lengthen by the same amount when a pair of hand levers are held down by the user. When the levers are released, the legs are locked in the new configuration for continued stair or ramp ascent/descent until re-adjusted at the end of the staircase or incline. In the default state where the legs are level and locked, the device performs exactly like a standard walker on level surfaces, making it the only walker a user will ever need regardless of the environment.
