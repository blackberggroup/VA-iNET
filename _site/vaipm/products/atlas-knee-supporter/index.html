<h1>Atlas Knee Supporter</h1>
<p>&#34;I really felt bad for the patient and knew there had to be a way to streamline the procedure while giving comfort to the Veteran. With the very first trial the patient loved it and wanted to take it home!! Throughout the prototyping phase I had such an adrenaline rush from any design changed needed.

Since 2021, the need to reschedule patients is at ZERO, and knee procedure time has been reduced by 15 minutes. Previously, 20% of patients were rescheduled due to pain, inability to hold still, or needing sedation. The benefits of the supporter and the data I collected include decreased radiation exposure to patient and staff, rescheduling, use of anesthesia and procedure time. The meaning of VA Innovation to me is knowing that I have lots of support behind me. I have had many people cheering me on and giving great suggestions. VA Innovation is the way to go!!!!&#34;

<p>The Atlas Knee Supporter was designed as a supportive device to immobilize Veterans and provide comfort during an otherwise challenging knee pain management procedures. It could, however, be used for any similar procedure where a Veteran needs to be secured and stable. The device comes in two sizes for different size legs and supports comfortably from the hip to the ankle.
