<h1>XanderGlasses</h1>
<p>XanderGlasses improve communication for individuals affected by hearing loss and auditory processing disorder by using sight to augment sound. The glasses translate speech to text and project accurate real-time captions in the wearer&#39;s field of vision, allowing them to look at speakers, absorb visual cues, and refer to captions as needed. This simple, on-off device provides instant and accurate captions with or without a cloud connection.
