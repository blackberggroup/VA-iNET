<h1>XanderGlasses</h1>
<p><a class=text-blue href=greenhouse-initiative.html>Greenhouse Initiative</a>, VA clinicians and Veterans across multiple VA healthcare systems, including VA Pittsburgh and VA Augusta Health Care Systems, participated in discovery interviews and user experience testing of this product.
&#34;Working with the developers of XanderGlasses has been very exciting and thoroughly enjoyable. I am a cochlear implant audiologist and realize the awesome benefit this device could have on helping hearing impaired Veterans to communicate more effectively with others.&#34;

&#34;I am really excited about seeing this product. If it works well, it will be a game changer for a number of people. This will be like being around for the invention of the telephone; it is that huge.&#34;

<p>XanderGlasses improve communication for individuals affected by hearing loss and auditory processing disorder by using sight to augment sound. The glasses translate speech to text and project accurate real-time captions in the wearer's field of vision, allowing them to look at speakers, absorb visual cues, and refer to captions as needed. This simple, on-off device provides instant and accurate captions with or without a cloud connection.
