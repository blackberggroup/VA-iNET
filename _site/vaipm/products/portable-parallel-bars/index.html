<h1>Wareologie Portable Parallel Bars</h1>
<p>Via the <a class=text-blue href=greenhouse-initiative.html>Greenhouse Initiative</a>, physical therapists and other frontline employees from the <strong>VA Richmond Healthcare System</strong> and <strong>VA Northeast Ohio Healthcare</strong>, participated in the co-design and user experience testing of this product.

&#34;It was an awesome experience to work with the team Wareologie to take this great idea and see it come to physical fruition! We started from scratch with an idea on a power point, discussing balancing a Physical Therapists wants vs needs, and what the patient would absolutely need in order to feel safe and secure.

It is clear that the patients needs were most important, and the engineers really worked hard to understand what the patients would need for that tactile sense of security while also addressing the operational functions and materials.

Each meeting, we were able to collaborate our clinical needs with the engineers&#39; structural knowledge to create what we think will be an incredibly useful and versatile tool for multiple clinicians in different settings.&#34;
