<h1>Hinged Bathtub Bench</h1>
<p>The benches and support legs of the most popular bathtub transfer device solutions extend beyond the width of the bathtub and do not allow the user to easily close the curtain during bathing. This results in unwanted, wasted space in the bathroom and the potential for water to escape the bathtub surrounding it.
These problems can introduce trip, slip, and fall hazards to users that already have difficulty ambulating and performing routine, daily tasks. A smaller footprint bathtub bench with a hinged transfer platform eliminates both of these issues.
The Hinged Bathtub Bench features a hinged platform that rests on the lip of the bathtub. This allows the user to transfer into and out of the bathtub, all while being able to close the curtain inside of the tub to prevent water from escaping. The bench is assembled completely within the walls of the bathtub, taking up less space outside of the tub making navigation in the bathroom much easier.
