<p>&#34;We can work smarter, not harder. Developing this product opened me up to a large network and the depth of iNET support that VA offers when they bring an idea to the forefront.

VA Innovation made me realize the VA is one of the biggest innovators out there in the nation&#39;s healthcare system! We are on the forefront of many new products in our industry!&#34;

<p>The Cart Sweeper Attachment is a simple device which attaches to the bottom of a housekeeping/janitorial cart. The device allows you to sweep the floors as the cart is pushed along its usual route throughout the hospital. This tool improves the cleanliness of the hospital environment by keeping floors clear of dust, dirt, and debris.
