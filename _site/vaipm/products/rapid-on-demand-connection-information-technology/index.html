&#34;Unnecessary suffering or dying at-home because someone can&#39;t afford quality internet, especially when a cost-saving model of care solution is available is important to me.

Developing this product made me proud of myself again, gave me a purpose, got my fight back, and increased the ratio of salt in my hair. To me, VA innovation means pushing the entire country&#39;s care model forward and sharing it in an open-source manner for all people.&#34;
