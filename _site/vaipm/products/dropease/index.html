<h1>DropEase</h1>
<p>&#34;iNET makes me feel that I am being heard. More importantly, [that] the Veterans are being heard. I asked what the problem was, and then strived to find the answer; then take it back to the Vets so they can tell me how to make it better.&#34;

<p>The DropEase device provides a stable platform for self-administering eyedrops, complete with a handle that is easy to squeeze with weak or shaky hands. The device allows users to set a metered dosage to get the proper amount of medication every time. Standard eyedrop bottles fit into the device.
