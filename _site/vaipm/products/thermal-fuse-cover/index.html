<h1>Thermal Fuse Cover</h1>
<p>Mr. Doug Hilliard, the VISN 4 Prosthetic Manager, recognized that the contracted O2 vendors for his VISN were reporting that ~20% of Veterans were removing the inline safety fuses that have been installed for at-home oxygen therapy setups, thinking it may impede O2 flow. Sensitive to this potential home oxygen issue being a safety risk and being preoccupied with failure, he took immediate action coming up with solutions to prevent tampering with the inline safety fuse.

In his garage, Mr. Hilliard developed the initial concepts for the clamshell lock which would cover and lock the thermal fuse in place, preventing fuse removal. After the clamshell solution was conceived, he worked with the engineering expertise at the Human Engineering Research Laboratory (HERL) team to further develop prototypes and secure a patent, later working with OAM to establish production capabilities within the VA for distribution of this device to Veterans.

<p>The Thermal Fuse Cover is a protective cover designed to protect the OxySafe Cannula Valve thermal fuse product and resist from being tampered with or accidentally dislodged, while still allowing for normal use and function of the OxySafe fuse, the canulae, and the lanyard or facemask. The Thermal Fuse Cover is intended to be installed by a durable medical equipment provider and delivered to the patient&#39;s home as a part of their oxygen supply equipment.

The Thermal Fuse Cover is intended to be used for Veterans with at-home oxygen systems who are tampering with or removing the thermal fuse safety device. The Thermal Fuse Cover is another level of security designed to make it more difficult for this essential safety feature to be removed.
